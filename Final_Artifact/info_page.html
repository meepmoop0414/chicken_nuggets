    <h1>Welcome to the White Rabbit Hotel!</h1>

    <h2>This is our info page. You're welcome to browse around, but we know you'll book with us anyways.</h2>
    <br>
    We don't have memberships. You and I both know you'll always come back. Maybe you'll even stay forever...
    <br>
    Just kidding! Our rooms and services differ greatly by with or without membership and then by membership ranking.
    <ol>
        <li><h2>Diamond:</h2></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Oh my! It's an honor to be a Diamond.</li>
            <li>The process is quite selective. The game changes every year.</li>
            <li>In any case, you'll be allowed first pick of the rooms, even if another patron has booked it.</li>
            <li>You'll also be given our custom servies for free! See the Gold and Silver areas for more info.</li>
            <li>You'll have full access to a special wing of the hotel!</li>
            <li>they obey you now.</li>
            <li>How much is it? Oh. Well. Your mortal possessions hold no weight by this point. Perhaps a few lives could be offered to us. Once you are a Gold, we'll find a way to connect you the Grand White Rabbit himself!</li>
            <li>He'll be the one to tell you if you'll be allowed to...be included in the next Diamond selection.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li><h2>Gold:</h2></li>
        <ul>
            <li>You outrank all but Diamond members. Not to worry, there aren't very many of them.</li>
            <li>You get second pick of rooms.</li>
            <li>You'll have to pay a price, but you have access to our special services.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>They'll listen to some of your orders for a price. $???</li>
                <li>Garden tour and access $250</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Hm. You're in limbo.</li>
            <li>You outrank 2 but are outranked by 2</li>

            <li>We can't offer you many benefits.</li>
            <li>You should've purchased at least silver...</li>
            <li>At least we'll be able to offer you a room, I suppose</li>
            <li>But there won't be many options since the other ranks put our rooms in high demand</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li><h2>None:</h2></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Oh dear...I'm afraid we'll only be able to offer you a backroom. You understand, right? We're quite busy and members must come first.</li>
